//An ideal situation would be that the end result Would 
//be such that a GUI interface would allow the creation 
//of a graph or simple 3D rendering which would 
//represent A garden or growing space, or series of 
//gardens or growing spaces. This in turn would be 
//linked with a number of data files. The data files 
//Would include, indoor or outdoor, latitude and 
//longitude, soil 'type/types' hardiness zones linked 
//by 'zip-code/postcode/or other geographical division' 
//or user input hardiness zone, condition of areas from 
//previous years. What was done to the soil at the close

//occurrences, plant diseases which are prevalent in the 
//area, user submitted plant disease occurrences in the 
//area. diseases that affected which type of plants in 
//previous years, pests which attacked which plants in 
//previous years, 
//Data set of plants with planting times, instructions, 
//days till harvest, pest tolerance or sensitivities, 
//disease tolerance or sensitivities, moisture 
//requirements, plants with positive interaction, 
//plants which react negatively
//way to enter soil test results
//detailed instruction on how to test soils and tell 
//different types of soil apart
//short explanation of difficulties involved in gardening

//possible later additions which would include aquaculture
//Ideally, pulling live data from weather forcasts for the

//This could be fed to algorythyms which would return 
//choices that might include reminders to do certain tasks 
//such at tilling soil, getting supplies off season when 
//possible to get better prices, purchasing needed supplies, 
//starting seeds, transplanting, weeding, hand polinating
